# YOLOv10_DSE
With the advancement of smart grid construction, substation equipment, being perpetually exposed to complex environments, is prone to latent hazards such as meter malfunctions and insulator cracks. Additionally, personnel violations may trigger safety incidents, directly jeopardising grid reliability. However, traditional manual inspections suffer from low efficiency and high rates of missed defects, while existing detection methods struggle to accommodate irregular defect classifications and multi-type defect characteristics, failing to meet engineering demands for real-time response and precise identification. To address these challenges, this research proposes a substation hazard detection framework based on an enhanced YOLOv10 (You Only Look Once version 10) architecture (YOLOv10_DSE). This framework is designed to enhance detection capabilities for multiple hazard types within the complex operational environments of substations.
